Analysis of Pottery Listings on Etsy - Capstone Project 2022

This is my final project for a MS in Computer Science and Quantitative Methods (Concentration Data Analysis and Management).

The purpose of this project is to analyze handmade ceramics listings on ETSY to identify market trends.  It uses the ETSY API (rather than a webscraper) to access the most recent 12,000 listings on etsy that match the keywords "stoneware" and "handmade"
